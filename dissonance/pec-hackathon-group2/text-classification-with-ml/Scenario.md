# Scenario : NLP/ML 
## Create an Application that can do below
- Application should be able to accept a given text as input, and classify into one of the classification options provided by the team. 
- You can either use a pre-trained data, or create a model with new training data.
- Application should expose a REST API, which will accept array of JSON objects and respond back with corresponding classification of the input received. 
- Application should be able to accept a pre-defined set of outputs, and find the closest match for any text from this list.

## Must Have (Core Scenario): 
- **Text Classification Model**
- Capability to take **list** of possible classifications expected as an input to the model, and **classify** the data accordingly

## Bonus Scenarios: 
- If using a **pre-trained data**, **build capability** to train this model with additional inputs and outputs.
- Build a web application that can take Inputs and return the output
- Login/Authentication control for the application
